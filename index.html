    <h1 style="font-weight: bold;"> Welcome to my profile!</h1>
    

   <p> <center>I am Frederick Joshua P. Paclibar. <br> I am a beginner at coding. <br>This is my First github experience
    <br> I love being alone and also spending time with the people I cherished so much. <br> I am friend with these super kind and beautiful people: Irrah, Shane, Sebas, Sam, and Nash.
    I love them so much and I will be a villain for them.<br> I'm having a hard time coding, but I am practicing to be better because I believe that a small progress will have a big result, maybe not now, but in the future.
    I also love learning languages from other countries, but now I am forced to learn programming languages.<br>
    I hate people who doesn't understand boundaries.<br>
    I love my mom.<br>
    I dont like my relatives.<br>
    I have a crush on Ronald.<br>
    My mom said she and Ronald are closed friends.<br>
    I don't have appendix.<br>
    I also experience what it feels like to die (mostly) it is somewhat thrilling and kind of exciting.<br>
    I purchased my eyeglass last February 20, 2024.<br>
